I did a sweepstake for a free vaction site. 
I choose this because I love traveling and would love a sponsored site that offered free vactions.
My goal was to practice with CSS styling, focusing on things we have been learning and putting them to practice.
My focus areas were sizing, scaling and positioning the page, the images and content on the page, 
I played around with it for some days now and still can't really get the positioning correct for images or the registration form.
Really exiting though and something I hope we loop back to and hope I will be able to correct some of the issues still with the site. 
This is practice and practice makes perfect.
